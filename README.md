# Equine-vs.-Homo-A-Deep-Learning-Approach-for-Distinguishing-Horses-and-Humans
I worked on a Neural Network Representations project in Coursera, I focused on distinguishing between images of horses and
humans in different angles and posture. To accomplish this, I employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture
consisting of six layers. The final layer of the network utilized the sigmoid activation function. Throughout the project,
I implemented various techniques such as image convolution to extract meaningful features from the input images. This
experience highlights my proficiency in utilizing CNNs and image processing techniques to tackle real-world classification
problems
